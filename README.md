# ABOUT ME
💻 I’m a CSE student at BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engineering for Women with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and exploring new technologies.

🎯 My goal is to work at Google Hyderabad and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference. I love taking challenges head-on and turning ideas into working code.

💡 Skills: C, Python, Java, DSA with C, HTML, SQL, Excel
🚀 Learning: JavaScript, Advanced DSA

✨ I enjoy creating meaningful projects, contributing to open-source, and sharing knowledge with the community. I always try to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

🌟 Leadership Role: I’m a Class Representative Committee (CRC) member and actively maintain class responsibilities.
I coordinate with peers, organize events, and ensure smooth communication between students and faculty. Leadership has taught me teamwork, time management, and problem-solving in real-life situations.

🌱 When I’m not coding or leading, you’ll find me exploring tech trends, attending workshops, or experimenting with small projects to sharpen my skills.

🔥 I believe learning never stops, and every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Let’s code, learn, and build amazing things together!
